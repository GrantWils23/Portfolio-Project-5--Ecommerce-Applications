                <h1>About us....</h1>
                <p>Airsoft workshop is a startup project setup by an enfusiastic airsoft player, with 5 years of
                    experience playing out in the fields. Upon getting incredibly hooked on the sport.
                    <br><br>Airsoft is a great hobby, where you can make lots of new friends and through this experience
                    I got the inspiration speaking to fellow airsofters about the difficulties assosicate in airsoft.
                    Players are often wanting to spray paint their RIFs and repair their weapons when they have
                    problems, but this is where the Airsoft workshop provides its customers the best care and attention
                    regarding getting your RIFs exactly the way you want them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you are interested in getting to know me before you would like me to do any work on your RIF, I
                    invite you to meet me in store or even out on the field. As an airsofter, it is important to meet
                    the people in the game and there is no better time then on an actual game day. So if you are, feel
                    free to <a class="page-link-success" href="{% url 'contact_us' %}">contact us</a> and we will be able to tell you what airsoft
                    site I will be attending.
