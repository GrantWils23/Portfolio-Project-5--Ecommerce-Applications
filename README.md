<h1>Portfolio_Project_5 --- Ecommerce Project</h1>
<h1>The Airsoft Workshop</h1>

<p>The Idea for this website came from my hobby. I am an airsofter and it is my biggest passion outside work. I got really envolved in the sport and have always looked at the idea of working more closely within the airsoft community and would like to provide a unique, bespoke service that offers spray painting, camoflaging of Realistic Imitation Firearms (RIFs). When i speak with fellow airsofters they always would like a way to stand out from the crowd and have unique equipment and that is where the airsoft workshop comes into play. from selling consumables and to offering high-end services such as maintainance and repairs.</p>

## Project Management
To work along with the user stories that i created to help build the site, I used GitHubs's Project Board to manage my workflow. The Kanban style work board is very useful when trying to implement a working Agile environment. This tool helped me break down the importance of time management and helped me track my progress. It's a super powerful tool, with the abiltity to add small notes and labels to items within the project board.

## Data Model
Here below you can find the Data schema used to create the data model. This was useful in helping me understand the flow and direction on how to create the app models, views and templates. A well working data schema is important to the database be established properly for the website to work correctly.

## Wireframes
The Wireframes for this project started off as a base idea with some users feedback from some of my friends who would use a service and they gave me feedback as time went on. These basic templates were the foundation of which the website style is built on but with the help of real user feedback I implemented it along the way.

<!-- Links or images to wireframes go here -->

 ## Site Structure
The site structure is extremely important to the clients who will wish to book an appointment with BeBeauty. It is imperative that the site is user friendly and easy to access, read, and find the pages you want to with the least hassle. The site structure will consist of a navigation menu bar that will be present at the top of all pages as well as a footer with the appropriate social links. The body of the pages will be broken down into the following... <!-- template from old project - edit accordingly -->
<ul>
    <li>Home Page</li>
    <li>Services</li>
    <li>Prices</li>
    <li>Gallery</li>
    <li>Contact</li>
    <li>Sign Up</li>
    <li>Sign In</li>
    <li>Sign Out</li>
    <li>My Bookings</li>
    <li>Create Booking</li>
    <li>Booking Details</li>
    <li>Edit Booking</li>
    <li>Cancel Booking</li>
    <li>Delete Bookig</li>
    <li>Admin-Planner</li>
    <li>Admin Add Booking</li>
    <li>Admin Edit Booking</li>
    <li>Admin Cancel Booking</li>
    <li>Admin Delete Booking</li>
</ul>

The Desktop version of the site is very spacious but when the user drops down to a smaller aspect ratio the content will be forced to occupy a majority of the screen not to waste the restricted space that is left on the display. So any Wireframes above that take up larger areas with content and spacing will be forced to a column that occupies the screen so it displays all on one screen with no side to side juddering. This will greatly improve the UX as it will be easier to use on smaller devices, just as it would be on a desktop or larger screen device.

# Web Design & Stylings

To speed up the process of making a really interactive website page, I learnt to use Bootstrap to its full capability to help design an aesthetically pleasing website that and then created custom details to the brands design to give it a unique appeal and enhance the UX. by using bootstrap, I have access to working, proven code that has help build an offcanvas menu bar, cards, toasts and footers. and it allows me to spend more time on the core structure of the website in the logic and how the site should operate. below are some specification detailng the other design aspects of the website...

## Colour Scheme
the colour scheme chosen for this website is a submersive navy-blue/black colour and dark grey  <!-- colour tags go here -->. This is really nice as it highlights images and makes reading easy as a light grey font was chosen to work in contrast with the background color.

the colour scheme also around the website largely uses hints of green throughout to add the unique personal touch of the Airsoft Workshop website. As the main logo font is green, it naturally appears throughout the website to give the user an enhanced UX.

- Functional buttons within the booking pages hold a simple colour scheme of:

### Services Page
The services page is designed to give the users a brief insight into the services of what the company offers its clients with a description of the beautician’s experience and really is where you get a feel for the company and the professional nature of it. The page is designed to be eye-catching and give the user a well-rounded experience as they view what company has to offer.

[Back to Existing Features](<#existing-features>)
<br>

### Prices Page
The prices page gives and accurate breakdown of the services that BeBeauty has to offer, as well as the description and prices and approximate time it takes each session. It is displayed in a list format to give users a clear presentation that is navigate to the service they are most interested in. It uses a modal to display the larger information of each booking. The modals give the user a real user friendly feel as it is free flowing the colour scheme matches the rest of the websites design giving a very pleasant UX.

### Gallery
The gallery is a small sneak peak of just some of the work that BeBeauty has done for some its clients. The current idea is to have a small sample of photos with which the users can see now. If the users want to view more, they are encouraged to check them out on the social media links located below for more day-to-day photos if you follow them on the likes of Instagram or Facebook. This will likely change, and the owner may wish that they have a more robust website with a larger gallery later.

[Back to Existing Features](<#existing-features>)
<br>

### Contact
The contact page is small and consists of the T&C's of the company's policy and how they operate. It is a clean format that clearly labels all important details regarding any bookings. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178741286-6607523f-77b7-4833-8500-b4fe8820ed3e.png)

<br>

### The Booking Form
The booking form is a simple and easy to use, once signed in it knows you are a valid user and so it generates the user and email name already for submission.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178740493-0c2a52f6-af0e-49ca-9dce-0b9a7b31c1dd.png)

[Back to Existing Features](<#existing-features>)
<br>

### My Bookings
The bookings page is a paginated page that displays a max of 6 appointments on any one page before having to cycle through to view more previous bookings. Its list view is very easy and clear to read and is set up according to the booking reference. The page displays the most significant information within the list view and has a link to view the booking attached to it. to the right side is the bookings edit and cancel buttons that give the user the ability to edit and cancel bookings or just to view old or completed bookings.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178739501-9bc45d9c-aaed-409b-ac30-13405a2dfdf2.png)

[Back to Existing Features](<#existing-features>)
<br>

### Booking Details
The booking page holds all relevant details required regarding the booking. Located at the bottom of each booking is again buttons to edit and cancel the booking giving the user more than one way just to alter a booking, which prevents having to scroll through multiple pages just to alter it and giving the user a warmer UX.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178742207-3c9c101e-bbb9-48ba-b6be-fa482c878ae5.png)

[Back to Existing Features](<#existing-features>)
<br>

### Cancel and Delete Bookings
This Page is a warning page for the user, it alerts them to the actions they plan on taking. By diverting to a new page, it gives the user a warning in clue of a visible prompt that with the request they plan to make will alter the booking in some way, this gives the user a greater UX when it comes to making sure they didn't cancel the booking by accident.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178741783-e1991d20-abf3-4c8c-9072-ca5c367ee852.png)

[Back to Existing Features](<#existing-features>)
<br>

### Footer
 The Footer is lightweight and is very minimalistic, this gives greater UX to the rest of the page as the footer displays social media links which is there for users who want to view more about the company outside of the dedicated website. The links are large and blend in with the rest of the page to show there is some significance in clicking the links. The social links would be directly linked to the businesses pages once the website is set for production.

<br>

### Pop-up messages
The pop-up messages are integrated into the websites UX to provide the user with some useful feedback information. The messages will display on the success of a given task like signing in or upon a completion of a given task, or in the event of something failing, like the appointment booking is not possible, it will throw and error to the user in a message box. below are some examples...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/178992505-afc8e9df-c791-4379-84a1-7a1edc6c4906.png)

## Input Validation and checking
<!-- template from old project, change accordingly -->
Validation of the form is implemented by checking before the document is submitted is valid to submit. This is achieved by multiple methods:
<ul>
    <li>TTo validate the phone number being entered into the form, django-phonenumber-field was used. It checks the input to see if it is a valid phone number and returns an error message if it is not valid upon submission.</li>
    <li>To validate the date of which a booking can be made, within the form.py is code to check that the date of which the form is greater than the date the booking is being made. If the booking is in today or before, the form is not valid and is returned to be resubmitted.</li>
</ul>

<!-- image here -->

<ul>
    <li>Validation of the Bookings that cannot coexist was implemented by making a constraint within the database and when such appointment already exists with the parameters of ‘appointment_date’ and ‘appointment_slot’ are met, then the code throws an error and addresses the user to pick another day or time for the appointment. (This was a bug I solved)</li>
</ul>

# Deployment

<!-- Update as I go -->

## Deployment of the project

### Deployment to Heroku
<p>To deploy the site is a labour intensive process. follow the steps below for a stress free deployment:</p>

First and foremost, if you are not a user of Heroku, sign up to its services, once you are logged in, in the top right corner there is a button "New". Click on the button and then click on "create new app".

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182254035-7a6d430b-10bb-4adb-acda-fe21e2a2cd8e.png)
 
Once the page loads, it asks you to put in an app name and your preferred region. I choose Europe as it is my current region.
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182254260-b3818089-7b60-4702-9ff3-4ef25acfc727.png)

Once inside the generated app, click on "resources" and then search for 'Heroku Postgres'. Attach this to your project. You must submit the order form. once added it will appear attached as a permanent to 'Add-ons' column.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182254632-aa6ba5ac-802f-469b-b5b2-c9ff98798b52.png)

If you click on the Heroku Postgres link, it will redirect you to a new page with the information about your Heroku Postgres Database with all the credentials. Click on 'Settings' and then click 'View Credentials' and it will show you your database credentials. below is the image of my credentials.
 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182255490-5e325002-cf77-45b0-893d-e491ba0f09ab.png)

From the credentials you will want to look at the URI. We will copy this over and add this into our Config Vars:

Return back to the Heroku app page and click on 'settings'. Once inside settings, scroll down to the project settings and click 'Reveal Config Vars'. Add the following config vars to the project:
<br>

NOTE: Before deployment we will need to remove the ```DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1``` var. This is currently in place for the development stage. When you delpoy the app make sure you remove this.
<br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182256504-079ad16f-cffc-4494-9bae-7d95a85d8f95.png)
 
Now go back to VSCode and create a new file called <b><i>env.py</i></b> if it has not already been created. <b>Make sure you add it to your '.gitignore' file</b>. copy the code below. This is nothing new, its just the same config vars from the heroku app and we need them inside our env.py file. make sure to add <b>your</b> config var values inside.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182257529-09ce9e5d-9ba7-410c-a745-25c86e6506aa.png)

Inside settings.py, search for the line that says "from pathlib import Path" and then insert the code below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182257894-26c2518f-2fbf-401a-b26c-6a845945ecf0.png)

Replace the default random security key that Django provides you with your SECRET_KEY variable that you created in your env.py file.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182258087-fd940b53-a297-49fa-8445-dcd45aba6892.png)

Set <b>DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ</b> This allows you to have Debug set to True when developing locally. However DEBUG will be set to False when deployed to Heroku.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182258392-dcce5dac-62ea-48fc-a9d0-35e9b5a7d956.png)

Whilst working in development, we want to keep the PostgreSQL for deployment. So, running the code below allows us to have two databases. SQLite for local development and the PostgreSQL database for the deployed application.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182259041-4743cadc-e401-44ab-a440-4d64c40305b3.png)

Next we need to add cloudinary application to the INSTALL_APPS in settings.py: <b>The order of the  apps in this list is important, copy as below.</b>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182259381-0c8589cd-e570-4679-982d-b6c7dfef087f.png) 
 
Then we need to go to STATIC_URL = '/static/' in the settings file and copy the code below... this tells django to use Cloudinary to store media and static files
 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182259693-72cd2070-895d-4473-8576-26819495480c.png)

After that we can add the code for the Templates into the settings.py copy the code below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182259902-c01aef57-3de8-4d13-a3e2-0fed1f491249.png)

Next add your allowed hosts to ALLOWED_HOSTS. You will need to add ```'127.0.0.1'``` to your local host list to allow you to open it locally, as well as ```'localhost'``` and ```'bebeauty-deployment-process.herokuapp.com'```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182463546-97ee9b7e-072b-41ac-bbc4-81557fe9dd5f.png)

Now inside the top level directory we need to two new folders and one new file:

#### STATIC
<li>Add a static file that will hold your images, and css folders and anything else. i.e. js files and/or favicons.</li>

<br>

#### TEMPLATES
<li>Next add the templates folder where the project will keep all the HTML files that will will be used to build the webiste.</li>

<br>

#### PROCFILE
Once those files are completed, we need to add a Procfile for the website to work. So again, from the top level directory, we need to add a Procfile and within the file write the command... ``` web: gunicorn 'APP_NAME'.wsgi ``` within the file. This allows the file to run your in Heroku.

(My Example from BeBeauty)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182356833-bbfa158f-942b-4538-b78c-0b72edfcc6a1.png)


If you are unsure what your app name is, you can find it and the resources page of your heroku app page, just look at the exmaple below if you are not sure...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182356444-15549040-be85-465d-bb7d-da5616823a00.png)

Once completed, make sure you save all the files and then type the following lines:

* ```git add .```
* ```git commit -m "deployment commit"```
* ```git push```
<br>
Then the final step is to deploy your application, if you wish to deploy using the Heroku CLI follow the lines of code below:

* ```heroku login```
* ```heroku git:remote -a APP_NAME```
* ```git push heroku main```
<br>
Alternatively, if you wish to do it from within the Heroku website and through github, follow the steps below:

1) Within your Heroku app, click on the deploy tag.
2) On the deployment section in the middle, select GitHub.
3) Once you log in to github through Heroku, you should get a search menu appear.
4) Search for the repository within your Github account for the app you will create and then hit the "Connect" button.
<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182438506-65c4d13a-29dd-492c-a710-452fa1fe8110.png)

5) Once connected, you will be presented with two methods to deploy the website, Automatic and Manual Deployment. Choose whichever one is more conventient for you.
<br>

(Side Note: When the app is deployed, Debug has to be set to False! this is for security reasons as it can expose sensative data.)
<br>

### Cloning and setting up of this project
<hr>



<p>To create a local clone of the project, follow the steps below:</p>

* In the GitHub repository, under the repository name there is a code tab., click on the 'code' tab. and select either HTTPS or CSS link to copy the code. I will use HTTPS:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182441657-b4116d59-ee58-4a4d-9826-2119bd34d7a8.png)
* In the clone tab, click the HTTPS tab. Within this section, click on the clipboard icon and copy the URL supplied for the repository.

* Once the link has been copied, open an IDE (Command Prompt) of your choosing, navigate to where you wish to store the project and run the following terminal commands:

1. ```"git clone HTTPS or SSH link``` - This will clone the project to your computer
2. ```cd name of project``` - This will cd (change directoy) into your project
3. ```code .``` - This will launch your project in VSCode
<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182444495-9a5f9b21-e7e2-4a99-b055-937a7232470e.png)

Now you need to setup and initialize a virtual environment for the project. follow the steps below to setup a virtual environment if you haven't done so before.

```$ pip install virtualenv```
<br>
(Step.1) Test your installation was successful:

```$ python3 -m virtualenv -- version```
<br>
(Step.2) Then create the virtual environment using virtualenv

```$ python3 -m virtualenv myenv```
<br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182444824-9bafb75a-cae4-4cef-b00b-d22d9a619336.png)
<br>
(Step.3) After creating the virtual environment, you need to activate it. <b><i>We need to activate the virtual environment every time you will work on the project!</i></b>. This can be achieved by using the following command:
<br>

* ``` $ source virtualenv_name/bin/activate ``` - [For Mac] 
* ``` $ source virtualenv_name/Scripts/activate ``` - [For Windows]  (as in my example below):

!![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182445439-bca1e977-081b-46ea-85c3-312b04543870.png))

<b>Don't forget to addd the env to your .gitignore file</b> if added correctly the file and its content's font shall be shaded a darker grey.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182445548-45a57c2b-d86a-491e-bd25-3b03f93d0892.png)

Once you are in the virtual environment, the terminal will have it appear in brackets next to the command line as in the image below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182445662-f576728c-a54e-48de-92a3-98439108785b.png)

NOTE: To deactivate the virtual environment just type ```deactivate``` into the terminal (like in the image below).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182445800-b322a679-751f-4ad3-af36-416b91451d23.png)
<br>
<hr>
Now within the virtual environment, we now need to install the project requirements to run the project. in the virtual environment terminal, type in the following command:

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

What this will do is download all the app's dependencies stated in the requirements.txt file which will get the project to work.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182447722-1b86059c-319a-4ef1-9db5-7900de0b4374.png)

With that now complete, We now need to create our env.py file, which tells the app what variables to use. These variables are usually hidden for security reasons as they contain sensative data that we don't want leaked and can be dangerous if shared publicly they can be vulnerable to attacks. So what we must do is first create the env.py file and immediately add it to our .gitignore file.

Any variables you declared in your settings.py file must be added to this file. (Apart from ["DEVELOPMENT"]) to your config vars when you deploy in Heroku.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182455915-2e6da191-999a-4ffd-8fe4-0494d232e6a0.png)

Now when we run the command ```python3 manage.py runserver``` if the terminal will respond with unapplied migrations which is to be expected as we haven't made any migrations into the database. If this is the case, run the migrations command in the terminal... ```python3 manage.py migrate```.

Once it has finished applying the migrations, you will need to run the command ```python3 manage.py runserver```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182458479-9d27b5ac-542c-40e4-a11e-2ed937375e73.png)

This will now launch the project locally, successfully and ready for development.

The test files that exist in the project can be run with the simple command ```python3 manage.py test```. 

If you wish to test a particular app you can run the command ```python3 manage.py test "APP_NAME"```

(for example, the specific APP_NAME's from BeBeauty are 'booking' or 'treatment')

This command will only work if you use your local database within the deployment. if for any reason you run this command using the Heroku database, the test will fail. please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/GrantWils23/Portfolio-Project-4--Full-Stack-Toolkit/blob/main/tests/TESTS.md">testing</a> file to see how the tests perform.

This project has installed inside it a python package called [*Coverage*]. This app is useful as it gives you comprehensive reports on how much of your project has been tested. To get a coverage report, run the following command in the terminal: ```coverage report``` and this will output a tabled list of the results from the report. The report gives you an idea of what areas perhaps require more testing and gives you a score on how your tests perform.

<br>

### Setting the email service

There is one part of the project that hasn't been explained in the above. I have set up the app to send emails and to do this I created at the bottom of settings.py. What we have here are two two config vars that we need to add to your env.py file. The ```['EMAIL_HOST_USER']``` and ```['EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD']```. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182680072-b77a00e2-2c0b-4c93-a2bf-1a7f24f56a12.png)

 I found a really useful tutorial by "Toumi Abderrahmane" on how to set up googlemail sync up to send emails with django in deployment. please click on this link below.

<a href="https://dev.to/abderrahmanemustapha/how-to-send-email-with-django-and-gmail-in-production-the-right-way-24ab" target="_blank">how to send email with django and gmail</a>
<br>

Within the env.py file, at the bottom two lines, you have to insert you email address and password, just look below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72948843/182467606-e6d25616-caf0-4b54-8bcf-abf559771028.png)

Now with this done, you can now send emails in development and deployment.
 (Note there is a code at the bottom of the Development Django Email Settings, run this in the command line to check your emails send.)

## Credits

<p>Building the website was a very hard process but very rewarding. I would like to mention below some credits to my project:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I used Bootstrap a lot when building this website. I mentioned a link to the website in the above technologies used section.</li>
    <li>Django documentation was used a lot during the build of the website to make sense of how to build the MVT. The documention is very thorough and explains a lot of things clearly. When I had a problem, I could read their docs with a large degree of success</li>
    <li>I also used <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stacker Overflow</a> to help me when I had problems as there was a lot of times people had the same problems as I and I could lean on some of these questions for help.</li>
</ul>
