        "description": "Looking for a way to broadcast your national pride or your love for CYMA and Taiwangun? The Patch Lab Polish SF SMG-5 3D PVC morale patch depicts a fully kitted out elite Polish operator packing a custom SMG-5 which looks a lot like the CM.041G. The patch is constructed from PVC with raised and recessed detail to create a 3D effect and has a subdued colour scheme of olive and grey. The Polish flag on the operator's helmet is in full colour, as are the CYMA and Taiwangun logos on teeny, tiny patches attached to the operator's dangler pouch. The level of detail in this patch is rather impressive, and it would look awesome with practically any loadout.\r\n\r\n- Limited edition 3D PVC patch\r\n- Velcro backed\r\n- Depicts a GROM operator and CYMA fan!",
