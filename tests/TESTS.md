## Manual Testing
<p>following the above User Story Tests, those tests coincide with the manual testing procedures of the website. A lot of the features above where check through manual testing to ensure a great user experience. Below is a list of the some of the features manually tested. </p>

## Input Validation and checking

Validation of the form is implemented by checking before the document is submitted is valid to submit. This is achieved by multiple methods

<ul>
    <li>To validate the phonenumber being entered into the form, django-phonenumber-field was used. It checks the input to see if it is a valid phonenumber and returns an error message if it is not valid upon submission</li>
    <li>To validate the date of which a booking can be made, within the form.py is code to check that the date of which the form is greater than the date the booking is being made. If the booking is in today or before, the form is not valid and is returned to be resubmitted. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Validation of the Bookings that cannot coexist was implemented by making a constraint within the database and when such appointment already exists with the parameters of appointment_date and appointment_slot is met, then the code throws an error and addresses the user to pick another day or time for the appointment. (This was a bug I solved)</li>
</ul>

## Automated Testing
<p>To check the code, I ran <a href="https://pypi.org/project/coverage/" target="_blank">Coverage</a> (A Third party package) to check how well my Automated tests performed. The report came back with a 73% coverage, the biggest areas that would require more comprehensive tests are the booking/views.py and the booking/forms.py. On a whole, The tests I have written have performed well but ideally greater coverage would be preferential.</p>
<li>I ran 27 tests with a 73% coverage.</li>
<li>To run these tests, you need to run the command <i>"python3 manage.py test"</i> in the terminal.</li>

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs
I had found a bug whereby if a user placed an order as a unregistered user, the code in my webhookhandler.py would not be able to find the order that was generated at the checkout view. This in turn created a double booking in the database, one for the frist correct order that had the right value charged by stripe, the second order will be the incorrect order with the wrong order information being inserted into the order with incorrect information regarding the grand total paid and shipping method cost changing and then the customer getting the wrong information was sent to them on the email.<br><br>After lots of time spent trying to find the fault for this, I had found that it was the django-phonenumber-field used in the model that was causing the problem. during the order process, it would not validate correctly, the order would be created before the forms self-validation would take place and it would cause the site to crash. Therefore decided to remove this from the order model and just keep it in the user profile form. That way, if the user sets up their profile first the form will validate the number here and it will be correct when the saved data gets used at checkout. if the user updates the profile, if for ever reason the telephone number is wrong, the form will prompt the user to make sure it is a valid telephone number.
